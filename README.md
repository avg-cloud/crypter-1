# crypter
A java based cyptography program to secure files.
This repositorty / code was created as an experiment to bridge the functionality of a desktop Java program with an Android App.
I will attempt to keep all future features of "crypter" and "CryptODroid" in sync.

The cryptographic algorythm in this program is compatible with it's Android App counter part version of this app is available on Google Play at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.admanne.CryptODroid&hl=en">CryptODroid</a>
