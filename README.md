# crypter
A java based cyptography program to secure files.
This repositorty / code was created as an experiment to bridge the functionality of a desktop Java program with an Android App.
I will attempt to keep all future features of "crypter" and "CryptODroid" in sync.<br>
<br>
A precompiled jar/binary can be downloaded <a href="http://aaron-manne.appspot.com/content/static/crypter.jar">here</a>.<br>
Run via "java -jar crypter.jar"<br>
<br>
The cryptographic algorythm in this program is compatible with it's Android App counter part on Google Play at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.admanne.CryptODroid&hl=en">CryptODroid</a>
